<br/>By using the Services, you can (1) download and access updates to certain applications already provided on your mobile phone as well as any related content, (2) download additional optional applications for your mobile phone, and (3) access content and other software applications (collectively “Applications”).<br />

<br/>“We” or “Samsung” means Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, whose principal place of business is at 416, Maetan-3 dong, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-City, Gyeonggi-do, 443-742, South Korea. You may contact us at the Help menu of the STORE.<br />

<br/>It is important that you take the time to read these Terms. These Terms and any of the documents referred to in the Terms form the legally binding agreement between us relating to the Services and your use of the STORE.<br />

<br/>Most of the Applications within the STORE are produced by third parties but Samsung also supplies some of the Applications. In the former case, you will be contracting with the third party Application provider and it is the third party and not Samsung who has the contractual obligation to you.<br />

<br/>Samsung reserves the right to charge for Applications. If we do this, we will give you reasonable advance notice and you will be required to register with us so that you can pay for the Applications. Failure to register will mean that you cannot receive Applications anymore.<br />

<br/>2. Accepting the Terms<br />

<br/>2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms. If you do not accept the Terms, you will not be able to access the Services. <br />

<br/>2.2 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are under 18 (but if you are between 13 and 18 and you have your parent’s consent, you may use the Services) (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the applicable laws of the United Kingdom or the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services or (c) you are in a country to which we do not provide the Services.<br />

<br/>2.3 If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 and you use the Services, we may ask you to confirm that you have had your parent’s permission and that they have agreed to these Terms on your behalf - even if we do not do this, we shall assume that this is the case and will provide the Services on this basis.<br />

<br/>2.4 Services may consist of multiple Applications depending on your device type, and some functions may be specialized or separated on certain devices.<br />

<br/>3. Service Territory <br />

<br/>4.1 To receive Applications from the STORE, you will need to register with us and agree to these Terms.
